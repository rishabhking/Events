        “I’m so grateful we found ORCHIDS! I planned a 170 person wedding in La
        Jolla remotely from SF. Lisa was our day-of coordinator and she went
        above and beyond to make our wedding a beautiful, fun and perfectly
        flowing day! ORCHIDS’s coordination was extremely valuable to us. They
        are a total professional - organized, sweet, quick, efficient and
        knowledgeable. I was blown away by the service they provided to me and
        my husband. First of all, I didn’t know which vendors to pick so I
        consulted ORCHIDS. Her recommendations were spot-on! I kept hearing that
        our vendors that our vendor group was the dream team and I was totally
        thrilled with hair/makeup, catering, photography, lighting, etc... We
        also had some non-traditional vendors (flamenco band from LA that had
        never done weddings) and ORCHIDS were super cool about helping them get
        in wedding-mode and they were cool and flexible with my husband’s crazy
        last-minute ideas and adjustments! Our wedding day was beautiful but a
        little bit hot under the sun for the guests. I really appreciated how
        ORCHIDS kept the ceremony perfectly on time so that no one had to suffer
        the heat longer than they needed to!!! Also, this left comfortable time
        for all the speeches, dancing etc... We also had a ridiculously big
        bridal party of 22 and ORCHIDS helped organize 11 rowdy groomsmen with
        ease. All of our family members praised ORCHIDS the day after and
        mentioned how on-top-of it she was and how nice she was. Lisa easily and
        graciously directed the day from start to finish and we all felt
        extremely relaxed trusting in their capable hands. The truth is -
        weddings can be stressful. I’m sincerely SO grateful we found Weddings
        by ORCHIDS - She made our wedding perfect, fun, and memorable!”

        We had a joint 6th and 4th birthday party at the weekend for my two
        children. Our entertainers were fantastic - they managed all the
        children amazingly and kept them entertained and happy whilst managing
        to get them all seated for tea and ready for the cakes. The children had
        a blast and it meant the adults were also able to enjoy it all too.
        Thank you so much, we will be coming back for our third childs party too
        - highly recommend them.

        This was the 2nd tour my husband and 13 year old son did through ORCHIDS
        with our excellent guide, Mahmoud Saad. Mahmoud was very accommodating
        when my husband needed to buy something before we could get the tour
        under way. We went to the Great Pyramid where we were given some
        historical information before I went inside. This pyramid is much easier
        to get in than the Bent Pyramid but it was still a squeeze with alot of
        people going in and out. Totally worth it though! We then went on to a
        view point for photos and then a joint camel and horse & carriage ride.
        It was really useful to have Mahmoud to arrange all this. The
        camel/horse leader was very considerate and ensured our comfort and
        safety at all times. We headed to another view point where you could see
        all 9 pyramids. After this we visited the Sphinx. Sadly the Sun Boat has
        now been moved to the new museum Giza. We will have to come back one day
        to see that too. The restaurant where we had lunch served very good food
        and was able to provide a vegetarian option for me. I'd thoroughly
        recommend these tours, Mahmoud was a really knowledgeable guide, very
        friendly and helpful.
